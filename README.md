# Conquering Responsive Layouts

### [21-Day Challenge](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts)

This challenge is structured as a drip course, with the content spread out over a 3-week period.

A big part of conquering responsive layouts is a change of mindset. Afterall, all websites are perfectly responsive if you turn off the CSS. 

It's less about fighting with the CSS to make a layout responsive, and more about learning what to avoid to remove the responsiveness that HTML has as a default. This course is all about making that shift in mindset and getting you to feel comfortable with approaching a responsive layout.
